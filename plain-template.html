<h1> 
  Team Stats Since the NBA Trade Deadline
</h1>

<div class="placeholder">
 
  <p>I am not cultured on the world or current events. I like sports. If I have the option –the freedom– to do a project, I won’t do it on something serious. I choose, more often than not, to do the project on something in the sports world because sports are fun.</p> 

  <p>I was either going to do this project on the NBA or division one men’s college basketball. But I always leaned toward the NBA route because I already do an annual March Madness spreadsheet that I take great pride in. And frankly, I want to keep what goes into my spreadsheet private. It’s my secret formula if you will. (Correctly predicted FAU and UConn to the Final Four).</p> 

  <p>So I chose to dive into NBA stats. <em>Cleaning the Glass</em> has been a site that I’ve had bookmarked on my computer for multiple years. It presents the most essential team stats in a clear, user-friendly way. The most essential of the essential data is net rating.</p> 

  <p>Net rating, or “efficiency differential” is defined on the site as the following: Points scored per 100 possessions minus points allowed per 100 possessions. It’s the measure of a team’s overall efficiency.</p> 

  <p>After some consideration (see Data Diary), my first graph showed the net rating for every team since the February 9th trade deadline. But of course the graph was not, and still remains, not perfect.</p> 

  <p>One of the suggestions that Mark Krans, an AP statistics and pre-calculus teacher at Concord-Carlisle High School, brought up is that it would be more visually appealing to color code the dots on the positive end green on a scale that made the more positive numbers a more extreme shade of green, and vice versa: Red dots for the teams with a negative net rating with a more extreme shade of red for the really bad teams. The issue was either I was not proficient enough in Datawrapper, or, Datawrapper didn’t have the function to do that. So, unfortunately, that feature didn’t happen.</p> 

  <p>To make it more “catchy,” Krans suggested putting the logos of the teams instead of the cities. He did cite that there might be copyright issues with that. Either way, again, I did not possess the talent to make that change.</p> 

  <p>But the most riveting comment that he made was the inspiration for the second graph on this page (going from top to bottom.) “I wonder if a delta net rating since the trade deadline is more interesting,” Krans said.</p> 

  <p>As it turned out, it was. The difference between the net rating after the deadline versus before the trade deadline was an awesome revelation to me when I did the calculations and sorting in Google Spreadsheets. I knew that the Lakers, Knicks, Warriors, and Suns did much better after the deadline, but the fact that those were in fact the top four teams in this category of change in net rating was incredible. New York acquired Josh Hart (from Portland) which transformed their chemistry. Golden State got healthier. Phoenix made the big splash to trade for superstar Kevin Durant. (The Lakers did what I put in my “chatter” of the graph). One of the other critiques that Krans had with the first graph was that he wanted to know which teams traded with who and how did that impact their net rating. This second graph kind of answers that. So it was definitely gratifying to see those teams at the top.</p> 

  <p>I made sure to include the raw numbers of the pre and post-deadline for reference and kept the previous graph as you can see because all of that stuff provides helpful context. It also revealed what I had suspected about Portland, which was almost equally awesome to see graphically.</p>

  <p>The rebound graph was pretty simple but did raise some legitimate questions. First of all, with Houston for example, the 108.1% total rebound percentage “is really 54.05%,” Krans noted. He’s correct. It wouldn’t make sense for any team to grab over 100% of available rebounds. So that’s a quirk with this graph.</p> 

  <p>Krans and I also discussed the potential differences in showing opponent offensive rebound percentage instead of defense rebound percentage (initial internal debate brought up in the Data Diary) but agreed that it might invert the total percentage a bit.</p> 

  <p>By coincidence, Krans mentioned how New York has a much better defensive rebound percentage than Cleveland. And that inspired the secondary graph in this section of the data visualizations, which was a very easy look at the disparity between those two teams’ rebound rates against each other in their first-round playoff series that New York won in five games. Side note - by all accounts, Mitchell Robinson dominated against Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley in that series.</p> 

  <p>The last graph used to have the x-axis and y-axis flipped. But one of the last comments that Krans had was that “turnover rate is more of an explanatory variable than offensive rating. Offensive rating I would expect to be the response variable.” So I took that advice and flipped them.</p> 

  <p>On the original version of this graph, I only highlighted Golden State because they seemed to have an unusually high offensive rating given their turnover rate. However, Krans thought of an approach that made more sense:</p> 

  <p>“These statistics aren’t independent of each other. Like the Golden State Warriors only have 84% of their possessions to score on, because they’re turning it over 16% of the time.”</p>

  <p>As Krans also noted, “Who cares about turnover ratio when you’re scoring that much?” And why should you? The Warriors, with Steph and Klay, clearly can afford to turn the ball over so much because they shoot the ball so well.</p> 

  <p>In our conversation, we pushed the potential of this graph further: Why only look at the correlation between these two stats? Why not see which teams made the playoffs? That way, we can see, perhaps, which stat is more useful in predicting success. And as the revised, and now published graph revealed, scoring more points per 100 possessions is more important than committing turnovers. Unfortunately, I could not find a way to change the key to make it less overwhelming. Ideally, the key would’ve been “Playoff teams” is green and “Non-Playoff teams” in red. Oh well.</p> 

  <p>Overall, I’m happy with my series of data visualizations and really appreciated the insight from Mr. Krans.</p>

I found this person after reaching out to multiple SU professors, industry experts in the NBA (Trail Blazers, Jazz), and calling six statistics professors at Amherst College. Out of all of these people, only two of the SU professors responded to me, and neither had the time to talk. So I reached out to Mr. Krans, who was my AP stats teacher as a senior in high school, and he said sure. I conducted the interview over Zoom. </p>

<h3>
  Data Diary

  <div class="datadiary">

  <p>The main change that I made was I changed the date range of my data. Originally, for an assignment due in March, I used Cleaning the Glass four-factor data from the start of the regular season through that date, which was for all games through March 19th. But if I’m publishing data for this final project in May, then why would I want to use data that cut off on March 19th? So I changed the date range on Cleaning the Glass to February 10th through the end of the regular season (it didn’t have a function to include the regular season AND playoffs). February 10th is a purposeful date: February 9th is the trade deadline, so I want to look at how all these teams did post-deadline, which is a pretty good indicator of how a team is playing to end the season.</p>

  <p>In terms of net rating, a few teams jumped out when I made this switch: Brooklyn went from 15th to 22nd (Durant and Irving got traded), New York went from 7th to 1st (acquired Josh Hart), Golden State went from 14th to 6th (guys returned from injury), and the LA Lakers went from 21st to 7th (made several trades at the deadline to transform their roster). I am happy that I made these changes because these new net rankings are a better reflection of how teams ended the regular season.</p>

  <p>Link to where I got my data: <a href="https://www.cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors?season=2022&seasontype=regseason&start=02/10/2023&end=10/15/2023#"> the link</a><p> 

  <p>In Google Spreadsheets, I deleted the columns that had the rankings for each of the 10 statistical categories. I’m in the business of looking at the actual numbers, not the rankings. Plus, it was not visually appealing to in sheets to see a ranking in between two categories; I had to remind myself which ranking goes with which column.</p> 

  <p>I also got rid of the + signs within the net rating column because I think that’s what confused the pivot table when I wanted to use net rating. In addition, I made sure every number included one decimal point, even the numbers that ended in .0 just to keep things consistent. Plus, to make things make more sense for the user experience, I made a new column to the right of opp. ORB% and calculated DRB% (defensive rebound percentage). This way, I have the option graphically to see what looks better between ORB% and opp. ORB% or ORB% and DRB%. (ended up choosing DRB% instead of opp. ORB%)</p>

  <p>Mr. Krans provided awesome feedback on my original three graphs. Talking to him sparked the birth of two additional graphs - the change in net rating between post-deadline and pre-deadline and also to further the rebound graph with an example of the Knicks versus the Cavaliers in their playoff series.</p>
